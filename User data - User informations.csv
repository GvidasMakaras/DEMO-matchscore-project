I have previous working experience of 7 months as an HR/Social Media Marketing intern in Sevilla, Spain in the HR company “Spain Internship” (https://www.spain-internship.com/en/). During my past education I have a background of Languages, History, Geography, Chemistry and Biology. I changed my educational direction towards business since I am determined to be working towards the creation of my own business post graduation. Personally I can describe myself as a very motivated, energetic person that is interested in the field of Marketing, Sales, Managemen, Logistics and PR. I find quite interesting the processes of giving the customer what he needs and also introducing innovative products/services which create needs that haven’t been discovered yet. I enjoy presenting things in a different way, standing out from the crowd and displaying originality at all times. I am also very interested in sustainability, organic ways of life and ethical corporate behavior. I am a very creative person, always able to see things from a different angle and bring to the team a different approach. I am a team leader but I also work well within the team, making the team members feel comfortable around me. I am doing good on working on my own as well, I have no problem working independently on tasks and I am comfortable with it. I adapt to new environments and an international team or a team and company culture different than my own, since I have been living in The Netherlands for already nearly 5 years. I have been working in Spain for 7 months and I dif a nearly 4 month exchange program in Mexico. I am definitely cross-cultural communication experienced person, since I have lived, studied and worked in 4 countries and also I communicate with different people from a number of different cultural backgrounds. That gives me an advantage as I can see the business environment form the eyes of many different cultures I have experienced. When it comes to languages, I am a native Bulgarian speaker. I speak fluent English, good Spanish and  I also have a basic understanding of Dutch, German and Russian. Since Bulgarian language is part of the Slavic language family, I also have a basic understanding of other Slavic languages. I am living in Rotterdam as my University is located in the city, however I am open to traveling for my internship if traveling expenses are covered by the company.
